== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:

. Adding of *Item, ItemPrice, ItemName for the Expense Splitter* portion of EYLAH
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/issues/121[#121])

*** What it does: Allows the user to perform the `additem` command successfully hence adding an Entry which consists
of an Item into the current Receipt.
*** Justification: These classes are crucial for Expense Splitter to work because this the User
has to input an Item to split among his friends.
*** Highlights: Implementing the ItemPrice was a little tricky because Double should not be used to hold Currency
as it will lead to rounding errors.
Upon further research on Stack Overflow, I have decided that BigDecimal will be a better type to hold currency.
*** Credits: Online links where I researched on: "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1359817/using-bigdecimal-to-work-with-currencies"

Questions to ask: +
1. is BigDecimal the best way to represent currency? +
2. under ItemPriceTest, instead of assertFalse can I assertThrows because BigDecimal
will throw an exception? Because in AB3 everything there is assertFalse +
3.
