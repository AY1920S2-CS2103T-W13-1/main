== PROJECT: EYLAH

---

== Overview

EYELAH is a desktop application specifically programmed for Freshmen staying on NUS Campus. It aims to ease their lives
at halls/residential colleges by providing them with an application to split bills easily and help
them track their diet. The user interacts with it using a CLI and it is programmed using JAVA 11.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: [In Process]
** What it does:
** Justification:
** Highlights:
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

** *Adding of Height, Weight, Mode, Bmi and Self classes for the Diet Tracker portion of EYLAH*
*** What it does: Height and Weight are used when the User wants to store their personal health metrics into Eylah for the ease of Diet Tracking. Self is the object that represents the User in Eylah. Bmi is used to do calculations using the Height and Weight of the User.
*** Justification:
*** Highlights:
*** Credits:

** *Adding of HeightCommand, WeightCommand, BmiCommand, ModeCommand for the Diet Tracker portion of EYLAH*
*** What it does: HeightCommand, WeightCommand and BmiCommand are all health metric commands that are essential for any diet tracking app to help the User. BmiCommand is a simple function to allow the user to gauge their current health status.
*** Justification:
*** Highlights:
*** Credits:

** *Adapted most of the beginning classes for the DietModel class from Addressbook 3*
*** What it does: The Model and Parsers are extremely important in order to ensure a functioning pre-product.
*** Justification:
*** Highlights:
*** Credits:

** *Suggested for the renaming of same sounding class components across both DietTracker and ExpenseSplitter for EYLAH*
*** What it does: Allows the integration of the both Diet Tracker and Expense Splitter seamlessly in the unified Eylah class.
*** Justification: Otherwise, the name usages in the code would be lengthy and hard to read also. Class names in the unified Eylah files would include the entire path name of the Class file.
*** Highlights: I noticed this in my review of my team mate, Shee Xiong's, initial reorganisation of the code to allow for unification of both components. Upon further research as to why he may have left the class names as they were, I realised that it was because Java does not support **class name aliasing**, so we could not import the same named classes from DietTracker and ExpenseSplitter without first renaming them.
*** Credits: Understanding more about Java from "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2204157/class-or-method-alias-in-java"

Questions to ask: +
1. is BigDecimal the best way to represent currency? +
2. under ItemPriceTest, instead of assertFalse can I assertThrows because BigDecimal
will throw an exception? Because in AB3 everything there is assertFalse +
3.
