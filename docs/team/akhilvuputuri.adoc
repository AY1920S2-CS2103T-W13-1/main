EYELAH is a desktop application specifically programmed for Freshmen staying on NUS Campus. It aims to ease their lives
at halls/residential colleges by providing them with an application to split bills easily and help
them track their diet. The user interacts with it using a CLI and it is programmed using JAVA 11.

** Justification:
** Highlights:
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

** *Implement Storage for Diet Tracker in EYLAH*
*** What it does: Store food data of user so that when the app is restarted, the information still exists.

allows users to close the app and continue where they left off without doing all the work again.
*** Highlights:
