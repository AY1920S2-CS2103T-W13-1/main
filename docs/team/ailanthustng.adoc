== PROJECT: EYLAH

---

== Overview

EYLAH is a desktop application specifically programmed for university students staying on NUS Campus. It aims to ease their lives
at halls/residential colleges by providing them with an application to split bills easily and help
them track their diet. The user interacts with it using a CLI and it is programmed using JAVA 11.

== Summary of contributions

*Major Enhancements*

. *Added Entry and Receipt for Expense Splitter portion of EYLAH*

*** *What it does:* +
Receipt is used to store multiple Entries, and these Entries are meant to store the information about a particular Item
and the Persons involved in splitting the cost of that item.

*** *Justification:* +
These classes are required to keep track of items and the persons involved for each of that item.

*** *Highlights:*



. *Added AddItemCommand and DeleteItemCommand for the Expense Splitter portion of EYLAH*

*** *What it does:* +
It simply adds a new Entry into the Receipt or deletes an existing Entry from the Receipt.

*** *Justification:* +
The DeleteItemCommand feature allows the user to delete any items that he/she made a mistake on.

*** *Highlights:* +
These commands are only allowed to be used when the Receipt has not been marked as completed as this was accomplished
using a boolean flag in the Receipt class. This is because DeleteItemCommand actually removes the Amount owed by the person from the PersonAmountBook. So does the PaidCommand. As such, if a user uses the DeleteItemCommand after using the PaidCommand, and if the Amount owed goes to negative, an exception would be thrown due to the nature of BigDecimal. Hence, a flag was included to prevent this from happening.



. *Added DoneReceiptCommand and ClearReceiptCommand for the Expense Splitter portion of EYLAH*

*** *What it does:* +
DoneReceiptCommand marks the Receipt as done and ClearReceiptCommand removes all existing Entries from the Receipt.

*** *Justification:* +
DoneReceiptCommand is required to toggle the boolean flag of Receipt to be done. ClearReceiptCommand does the opposite
by toggling the Receipt back as undone.

*** *Highlights:* +
These commands are required to prevent an exception being thrown with regards to negative BigDecimal values, as
explained in the text above.



. *Added CalculateUtil and ParserUtil for the Expense Splitter portion of EYLAH*

*** *What it does:* +
CalculateUtil does all the handling of calculations required in EYLAH. ParserUtil parses all the inputted texts and
outputs them as the required Objects.

*** *Justification:* +
Abstraction, to make things easier and more streamlined in our application.
