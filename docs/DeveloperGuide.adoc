== Introduction

=== About EYLAH

Ease Your Lives At Hall (EYLAH) is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application designed to aid students staying in
*Temasek Hall within the National University of Singapore* with commonly faced problems such as,
*tracking their diet* and *splitting a large bill* with a group of friends.

Shown below is the CLI of EYLAH.

=== About this guide

This documentation serves as an introduction to the architecture and implementation of EYLAH,
and is made for developers who wish to maintain,
modify or understand the software development behind our application.
We adopted the top-down approach; we will first look into high-level
architectures before exploring implementation details of each feature.

We encourage you to traverse the full path from the high level design to the
implementation details of the feature you are interested for the most complete understanding.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

The sections below give more details of each component. +

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/splitterModel/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP splitterModel, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a splitterModel may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/splitterStorage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how the features in EYLAH are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== DietTracker feature

The Diet Tracker feature is designed to aid our users in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The feature comprises
of 9 Commands.

* <<Add-Command, `AddCommand`>> - Creates a new Food object with its attributes (Name, Calories) and adds it to the FoodBook Storage.
* <<Delete-Command, `DeleteCommand`>> - Deletes the Food specified by the input index from FoodBook Storage.
* <<List-Command, `ListCommand`>> - Lists the Foods and its attributes (Name, Calories) for the timeframe specified by users
based on their user input.
* <<Edit-Command, `EditCommand`>> - Allows the user to edit an of the Food in Storage.
* <<Bmi-Command, `BmiCommand`>> - Calculates the BMI.
* <<Height-Command, `HeightCommand`>> - Allows users to log their Height in centimeters.
* <<Weight-Command, `WeightCommand`>> - Allows users to log their Weight in kilograms.
* <<Mode-Command, `ModeCommand`>> - Allows users to toggle between different modes of the diet tracker.
* <<Help-Command, `HelpCommand`>> - Provides a help guide for users based on what commands are available.

Below are some diagrams to explain how our team implemented this portion.


*Activity Diagram* of Diet Tracker: +

image::activityDiagram_for_expensesplitter.png[]

[[Add-Command]]
==== Add Command

*Implementation*

The following is an activity diagram and a detailed explanation of the operations `AddItemCommand` performs. +

image::AddFoodActivityDiagram.png[]

1. The `AddCommand#execute(Model splitterModel)` method is executed and a new `Food` would be created.

2. The `Model#addFood(Food food)` method would then call `FoodBook#addFood(Food food)`.

3. The `FoodBook#addFood(Food food)` method would then add the food into a `UniqueFoodList`.

4. If successful, a success message will be generated by `CommandResult` and it will be returned with the generated
success message. Otherwise, an error message showing the correct command syntax is thrown as `CommandException`.

5. If the command syntax was valid and Food was added to the FoodBook, `LogicManager` calls
`FoodBookStorage#saveFoodBook(ReadOnlyFoodBook foodBook)` which saves the new Food
Amount into JSON format after serializing it using `JsonAdaptedFood`.

The following is a sample sequence diagram of the AddCommand.

.Interactions for add food command
image::AddFoodSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[Delete-Command]]
==== Delete Command
*Implementation*

The following is an activity diagram and a detailed explanation of the operations `DeleteCommand` performs. +

image::DeleteFoodActivityDiagram.png[]

1. The `DeleteCommand#execute(Model splitterModel)` method is executed and it validates that the specified `INDEX` to delete
is within range. If valid, the item to be deleted will be retrieved from Storage using its `Index`.

2. The method `Model#getFilteredFoodList() will then be called to retrieve the List of Foods from Storage.
`List#get(int Index)` is then invoked which retrieves the specified Food to be deleted.

3. The method `Model#deleteFood(Food food) will then be called to remove the Item from the List.
`FoodBook#remove(int Index)` is invoked which makes a call to its internal list to remove the specified Food.

4. If successful, a success message will be generated by `CommandResult` and it will be returned with the generated
success message. Otherwise, an error message showing the correct command syntax is thrown as `CommandException`.

5. If the command syntax was valid and Food was removed from FoodBook, `LogicManager` calls
`FoodBookStorage#saveFoodBook(ReadOnlyFoodBook foodBook)` which saves the new Foods
into JSON format after serializing it using `JsonAdaptedFood`.


The following is a sample sequence diagram of the DeleteItemCommand.

.Interactions for delete food command
image::DeleteFoodSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[List-Command]]
==== List Command
*Implementation*

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `ListCommand` performs. +

1. The `ListCommand#execute(Model splitterModel)` method is executed and it validates that the flag used to decide what
Foods to list. If the flag is valid, the items to be listed will be retrieved from FoodBookStorage according
to the input flag.

2. The method `splitterModel#updateFilteredFoodList() will then be called to retrieve the List of Foods from Storage.
`FilteredList#setPredicate(Predicate<Food> predicate)` is then invoked which retrieves the specified Foods to be listed.

3. If successful, a success message will be generated by `CommandResult` and it will be returned with the generated
success message. Otherwise, an error message showing the correct command syntax is thrown as `CommandException`.

The following is a sample sequence diagram of the ListCommand.

image::DietTrackerListCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[Edit-Command]]
==== Edit Command
*Implementation*

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `EditCommand` performs. +

1. The `EditCommand#execute(Model splitterModel)` method is executed and it validates that the specified `INDEX` to edit
is within range. If valid, the item to be edited will be retrieved from Storage using its `Index`.

2. The method `Model#getFilteredFoodList() will then be called to retrieve the List of Foods from Storage.
`List#get(int Index)` is then invoked which retrieves the specified Food to be deleted.

3. The method `Model#setFood(Food toBeEdited, Food editedFood)` will then be called to replace the Food toBeEdited with the
Food editedFood from the List.

4. If successful, a success message will be generated by `CommandResult` and it will be returned with the generated
success message. Otherwise, an error message showing the correct command syntax is thrown as `CommandException`.

5. If the command syntax was valid and Food was edited in FoodBook, `LogicManager` calls
`FoodBookStorage#saveFoodBook(ReadOnlyFoodBook foodBook)` which saves the new Foods
into JSON format after serializing it using `JsonAdaptedFood`.


The following is a sample sequence diagram of the EditCommand.

image::DietTrackerEditCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[Bmi-Command]]
==== Bmi Command
*Implementation*

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `BmiCommand` performs. BmiCommand has two different usages
depending on the user input. +

1. The `BmiCommand#execute(Model splitterModel)` method is executed and it will return the output of the calculated BMI
based on user arguments.

2. If successful, a success message will be generated by `CommandResult` and it will be returned with the generated
success message. Otherwise, an error message showing the correct command syntax is thrown as `CommandException`.

The activity diagram of `BmiCommand` is as follows:

image::BmiActivityDiagram.png[]

Given below are 2 example usages of `BmiCommand` based on different user input.

*Usage 1: No Height and Weight input*

Step 1. User launches application and enters `Diet` mode. The user then enters `bmi` as the command.

Step 2. The FoodBook parser validates this command and sets up the `BmiCommandParser`, which checks for the input.

Step 3. Since there are no arguments, the `BmiCommandParser` will call the empty constructor `BmiCommand()`.

Step 4. `BmiCommand` would then refer to the internal state of the splitterModel under Self, and retrieve the values stored in
Self's Height and Weight attributes.

Step 5. `BmiCommand()` will then proceed to calculate the BMI based on the current values of height and weight.

The following is a sample sequence diagram of the BmiCommand with no additional user input.

image::BmiNILSequenceDiagram.png[]
[NOTE]
There is a need to ensure that there are stored values in `Height` and `Weight` attributes in the `Self` class.

*Usage 2: With Height and Weight input*

Step 1. User launches application and enters `Diet` mode. The user then enters `bmi` as the command.

Step 2. The FoodBook parser validates this command and sets up the `BmiCommandParser`, which checks for the input.

Step 3. Since there are no arguments, the `BmiCommandParser` will call the empty constructor `BmiCommand()`.

Step 4. `BmiCommand` would then refer to the internal state of the splitterModel under Self, and retrieve the values stored in
Self's Height and Weight attributes.

Step 5. `BmiCommand()` will then proceed to calculate the BMI based on the current values of height and weight.

The following is a sample sequence diagram of the BmiCommand with additional user input.

image::BmiSequenceDiagram.png[]

*Design Considerations*

Aspect: How BmiCommand executes

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Executes with other without arguments
** Pros: More flexible use of the Command, better user experience overall.
** Cons: Harder to implement, as there needs to be multiple `BmiCommand` constructors.

* Alternative 2: Executes separately with arguments input and without arguments input
** Pros: Easier to implement, less potential bugs as Command uses a single constructor.
** Cons:  We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

Aspect: Storage of BMI

* Alternative 1 (current choice): No splitterStorage of BMI value, simply prints when user requests.
** Pros: Less memory used; reduces complexity of the Command and objects involved.
** Cons: Users may want to access it elsewhere from Self.

* Alternative 2: Storage of BMI value in Self class in Model.
** Pros: Users have access to it anytime.
** Cons: Coding complexity.


[[Height-Command]]
==== Height Command
*Implementation*

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `HeightCommand` performs. +

1. The `HeightCommand#execute(Model splitterModel)` method is executed and it validates that the specified `HEIGHT` to store
is a valid Height. If valid, the height will be stored in the `Self` class.

2. The method `Model#setHeight(Height height) will then be called to set the Height of the `Self` class.
`Self#setHeight(Height height)` is invoked which makes a call to its internal Height to replace the value stored.

3. If successful, a success message will be generated by `CommandResult` and it will be returned with the generated
success message. Otherwise, an error message showing the correct command syntax is thrown as `CommandException`.

The following is a sample sequence diagram of the HeightCommand.

image::DietTrackerHeightCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]


[[Weight-Command]]
==== Weight Command
*Implementation*

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `WeightCommand` performs. +

1. The `WeightCommand#execute(Model splitterModel)` method is executed and it validates that the specified `WEIGHT` to store
is a valid Weight. If valid, the weight will be stored in the `Self` class.

2. The method `Model#setWeight(Weight weight) will then be called to set the Height of the `Self` class.
`Self#setWeight(Weight weight)` is invoked which makes a call to its internal Weight to replace the value stored.

3. If successful, a success message will be generated by `CommandResult` and it will be returned with the generated
success message. Otherwise, an error message showing the correct command syntax is thrown as `CommandException`.

The following is a sample sequence diagram of the WeightCommand.

image::DietTrackerWeightCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[Mode-Command]]
==== Mode Command
*Implementation*

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `ModeCommand` performs. +

1. The `ModeCommand#execute(Model splitterModel)` method is executed and it validates that the specified `MODE` to store
is a valid Mode. If valid, the mode will be stored in the `Self` class.

2. The method `Model#setMode(Mode mode) will then be called to set the Mode of the `Self` class.
`Self#setMode(Mode mode)` is invoked which makes a call to its internal Mode to replace the value stored.

3. If successful, a success message will be generated by `CommandResult` and it will be returned with the generated
success message. Otherwise, an error message showing the correct command syntax is thrown as `CommandException`.

The following is a sample sequence diagram of the ModeCommand.

image::DietTrackerModeCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

=== Expense Splitter feature

The Expense Splitter feature is designed to aid our users with the splitting of large bills that involves meany people.
The feature comprises of six commands namely.

* <<Add-Item-Command, `AddItemCommand`>> - Creates an Item with its ItemPrice, Person(s) involved in splitting that Item and adds it to Receipt.
* <<Delete-Item-Command, `DeleteItemCommand`>> - Deletes an Item from the current Receipt and reduces the Person's amount accordingly.
* <<List-Receipt-Command, `ListReceiptCommand`>> - Lists the Item(s) in the current Receipt, its ItemPrice and Person(s) involved in splitting that Item.
* <<List-Amount-Command, `ListAmountCommand`>> - Lists the Person(s) Name and Amount they owe the user.
* <<Paid-Command, `PaidCommand`>> - Reduces the Amount a Person owes.
* <<Back-Command, `BackCommand`>> - Exits Expense Splitter portion to return to EYLAH's Main Menu.

Below are some diagrams to explain how our team implemented this portion.


*Activity Diagram* of Expense Splitter: +

image::ExpenseSplitterActivityDiagram.png[]

[[Add-Item-Command]]
==== AddItem Command

In this section, we will learn more about how the `additem` command is implemented.

*What is the AddItem Command*

The `additem` command allows the user to add an Item into the Receipt, along with the ItemPrice of the Item and the Persons
involved in splitting the cost of that Item.

The `additem` command was implemented as `AddItemCommand` in the `expenseSplitterLogic` package.

The `additem` command has the following input format:

`additem` `-i ITEMNAME` `-p ITEMPRICE` `-n NAME` `[-n NAME]...`

[NOTE]
====
* `-i ITEMNAME` and `-p ITEMPRICE` are *compulsory* fields.

* There can be multiple `-n NAME`, however, a minimum of 1 is required.

* `ITEMPRICE` can be up to 2 decimal places, i.e 7.99. There is no ened to add the dollar sign ($).
====

The following activity diagram illustrates what happens when a user executes the `additem` command:

image::ExpenseSplitterAddItemCommandActivityDiagram.png[]
Figure : AddItem Command Activity Diagram

*Implementation of AddItem Command*

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations AddItemCommand performs. +

1. The `AddItemCommand#execute(SplitterModel splitterModel)` method is executed and it checks if the specified `ITEM`
and `PERSONS` to be added are valid. If valid, a new `Entry` would be created with the specified `ITEM` and `PERSONS`.

2. The `SplitterModel#addEntry(Entry entry)` method would then be called to add the `Entry` into the Receipt.

3. For each person in `PERSONS`, the person is first checked through the `PersonAmountBook#persons` using the
`SplitterModel#hasPerson(Person person)` method to check if the person already exists.

4. If the person does not already exist, the method `SplitterModel#addPerson(Person person)` would be called to add the
person, together with the amount, into the `PersonAmountBook#persons`.

5. If the person exists, the person would be retrieved from the `PersonAmountBook#persons` using the
`SplitterModel#getPerson(Person person)` method, and then the amount would be added to that person using the
`SplitterModel#addAmount(Person person, Amount amount)` method.

*What is the DeleteItem Command* +

The `deleteitem` command allows users to remove the Item from the Receipt via the Index.

The `deleteitem` command was implemented as `DeleteItemCommand` in the `expenseSplitterLogic` package.

The `deleteitem` command has the following input format:

`deleteitem` `INDEX`

[NOTE]
====
* `INDEX` is a compulsory field.

* The Index of the Item can be retrieved by using the `listreceipt` command.
====

is within range. If valid, the item to be deleted will be retrieved from Receipt using its `Index`.

2. The method `SplitterModel#getEntry(Index index)` is called to retrieve the current Entry, which subsequently retrieves the
current Item using the `Entry#getItem()` method and the amountPerPerson associated with it via the
`Item#getAmountPerPerson()` method. The list of persons are also retrieved via the `Entry#getPersonsList()` method.

3. For each Person in the list of Persons, the amount is subtracted from the current amount owed by the Person.

4. The method `SplitterModel#deleteEntry(int index) will then be called to remove the Item from the Receipt.
`Receipt#deleteEntry(int index)` is invoked which makes a call to its internal list to remove the specified Item.

[[Paid-Command]]
==== Paid Command

In this section, we will learn more about how the `paid` command is implemented.

*What is the Paid Command* +

The `paid` command allows user to reduce the amount of money owed by a Person after they
have paid.

The `paid` command was implemented as a `PaidCommand` in the `expenseSplitterLogic` package.

The `paid` command has the following input format:

`paid` `INDEX` `[AMOUNT]`

[NOTE]
====
* `INDEX` is a *compulsory* field. Instead of typing a Person's name, the user
can type their index. To find out his/her index, use the command
 `listamount`.

* `AMOUNT` is an *optional* field. It refers to the amount paid by that Person. Leaving this field
empty is equivalent to the Person paying you the full amount he/she owes the user.

* `AMOUNT` can be up to 2 decimal places, i.e. 7.99.  There is no need to add the dollar sign ($).
====

The following activity diagram illustrates what happens when a user executes `paid` command:

*Implementation of Paid Command*

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations PaidCommand performs. +

1. The `PaidCommand#execute(Model splitterModel)` method is executed.

2. The `splitterModel#paidPerson(Person person, String amountPaid)` will be called.
String amountPaid will be converted into an Amount by instantiating a new instance of Amount.

3. The `personAmountBook#removeAmount(Person person, Amount amount)` is then called to remove Amount from Person.

4. Thus calling `UniquePersonList#removeAmount(Person person, Amount amount)`.

5. Lastly, `Person#removeAmount(Amount amount)` is called to subtract the amount.

*Sequence Diagram for Paid Command* +

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens during the execution of `paid` command.

1. The `BackCommand#execute(Model splitterModel)` method is executed.

2. The `CommandResult` with the `isBack` will set to true and returns to `EYLAH`.

3. The `EYLAH#runCommandLoopUntilBackCommand()` will check if `isBack` is set to true.

4. If the `isBack` is true, the `EYLAH` will return the the main menu. Otherwise, the
`Eylah` will continue running in Expense Splitter mode.

The following is a sample sequence diagram of the BackCommand.

image::ExpenseSplitterBackCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
