== Introduction

This user guide provides in-depth documentation on the EYLAH desktop application:
features summary, getting started, features, FAQ, command summary, and glossary.

Are you someone who *lives in one of the Halls Of Residences* in the National University of Singapore and
often goes out to *eat with hall mates?*  And do you also sometimes feel that you might be eating too much?
If yes, Ease Your Life At Halls (EYLAH) is a revolutionary new super-application that will make your life much easier!

EYLAH is an Expense Splitter and Diet Tracker rolled into one, for Temasek Hall residents who *prefer to use a desktop
app to solve issues. More importantly, EYLAH is *optimized for residents who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface*
(CLI).

EYLAH can solve your problems in halls by tracking your diet after those unhealthy supper runs
and splitting the cost after each outing or late-night party session with a few pokes of your keyboard. Interested?
Jump to <<Getting Started>> to get started. Let's go!
