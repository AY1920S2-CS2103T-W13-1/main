== Introduction

Ease Your Life At Halls (EYLAH) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app to solve issues related to Halls of Residences in National University of Singapore (NUS)*. More importantly, EYLAH is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, EYLAH can solve your problems in halls by tracking your diet after those unhealthy supper runs and splitting the cost after each outing or late-night party session. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
