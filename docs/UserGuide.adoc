== Introduction

Morpheus is for receptionists who prefer to use a desktop app for hotel room management. More importantly, Morpheus is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your hotel room management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
