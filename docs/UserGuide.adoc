== Introduction

This user guide provides in-depth documentation on the EYLAH desktop application:
features summary, getting started, features, FAQ, command summary, and glossary.

Are you someone who *lives in one of the Halls Of Residences* in the National University of Singapore and
often goes out to *eat with hall mates?*  And do you also sometimes feel that you might be eating too much?
If yes, Ease Your Life At Halls (EYLAH) is a revolutionary new super-application that will make your life much easier!

EYLAH is an Expense Splitter and Diet Tracker rolled into one, for Temasek Hall residents who *prefer to use a desktop
app to solve issues. More importantly, EYLAH is *optimized for residents who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface*
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, EYLAH can solve your problems in halls by tracking your diet after those unhealthy supper runs
and splitting the cost after each outing or late-night party session with a few pokes of your keyboard. Interested?
Jump to <<Getting Started>> to get started. Enjoy!
